# Day 16: Runtime Security Dossier (v1.0)

## Milestone Unlocked
Launched the static documentation site to host architectural specs.

**Why:**
Research was getting too complex for a single README. I needed a dedicated knowledge base for:
1. Sentinel Architecture (Interceptor vs Brain).
2. Ptrace Mechanics (Register ABI).
3. Threat Models (Ransomware Signatures).

**Artifact:**
* [Live Dossier](https://nevinshine.github.io/runtime-security-dossier/)
* Status: v1.0 Locked & Tagged.
